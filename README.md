What is this all about?

This little project is for me :-) I am trying to "Learn old dog some new tricks".

Use Python 3.4 or above. 

All this fun about developing GUI calculator in Python started with one stupid sentence. While my younger son and I waiting for doctor I said that stupid sentence. We were waiting in the room crowded by seriously injured or ill people. After a while you realise that waiting can take for hours. We start talk about what he currently learning in school. After geography, and some other things we start talk about programming class. I have start to explain possible beauty things that can be done by programming. And, enthusiastically, said that I am also now start to learning python as he. And we start to discuss what can be easy made by it. And, in one moment, I said: You can easy build calculator! He said: Real one? Me: Off course!!

Current version goals v0.03:
- *calculator_basic.py is now working version*
- learn Python classes
- learn how to create "cute" readme.md
- learn how to use GitHub
