# Description

*F*unny *T*hing *W*orks:
- *calculator_basic.py is current working version*
- input is from buttons and keboard
- operator precedence working
- equal sign do not behave as on real calculator
- division by zero will stop with error
- operator after operator will stop with error
- tkinter : use grid geomerty for the start if you don't want to spend huge amount of time to packing

Use Python 3.4 or above. 


# What is this all about? FTW

This little project is for me :-) Story and resources are below.

Feel free to copy, fork, distribute... whatever ... but don't blame me if you get bad mark at school. 
Neither if your Sirius rover fail to land on proper [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius) because of calculation made by this calculator.

*Software should be free.* Why and how? Read GNU [philosophy](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

Here you do not have to be afraid of propetary software. If you find some piece of it warn me and it will be removed.

Mail me at <vjeran.kenda@gmail.com> if you have some ideas how to improve or what happend when you try to run it. 

# Story
All this funny idea about developing GUI calculator in Python started with one stupid sentence. 
While my younger son and I waiting for doctor I said that stupid sentence. We were waiting in the room crowded by seriously injured or ill people. 
After a while you realise that waiting can take for hours. We start talk about what he currently learning in school. 
After geography, and some other things we start talk about programming class. I have tried to explain possible beauty things that can be done by programming. 
And, enthusiastically, said that I am also begin to learning python as he. And what can be easy made by it. 
And, in one moment, I said: You can easy build calculator! He said: Real one? Me: Off course!!

And, here I am. Discovering Python, GUI programing with tkinter, finite state machine...
